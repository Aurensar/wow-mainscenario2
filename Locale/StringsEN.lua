At the Frozen Throne, Sylvanas confronts the Lich King, Bolvar Fordragon, and defeats him and his assembled undead in combat, using the same unknown purple magic she used in the fight against Saurfang.\n\n\

    ["recap-09-40-10-copy"] = "After learning of the abduction of several faction leaders by Sylvanas' forces, you were summoned to the Frozen Throne to discuss a plan of action with Highlord Bolvar Fordragon.\n\
Bolvar has learned that the leaders have been taken to a prison realm in the Shadowlands called 'The Maw'. Accompanied by Darion Mograine and the Ebon Blade, you were tasked with infiltrating the Maw, locating your allies and finding a way to escape.\n\
The descent into the Maw scattered your forces, who were quickly overwhelmed by the Mawsworn. Only Mograine and a handful of Ebon Blade Death Knights remained as you began your search.\n\
You discovered Jaina defending an injured Thrall against Mawsworn forces.\n\
You retreated to a nearby cave, where Jaina and Thrall recounted their time in the Maw. It appears that they were being tested by a mysterious figure known as the Jailer, with whom Sylvanas has allied. Jaina knew the whereabouts of the others, but was unsure how to escape the Maw.\n\
With the aid of Mograine, you captured one of the more ancient, hostile souls in hopes of it knowing a way to escape the Maw.\n\
Jaina and Thrall accompanied you to the Tremaculum, where Anduin was last seen. After evading a confrontation with Sylvanas and defeating the warden holding Anduin captive, you and your allies returned to Forlorn Respite to check on Mograine's progress interrogating the ancient soul.\n\
Mograine's interrogation proved fruitful, and the soal revealed a possible exit via an ancient waystone near a place called Zovaal's Cauldron. Mograine and the Ebon Blade remained to guard the souls saved from the Tremaculum, awaiting your signal to regroup.\n\
En route to Zovaal's Cauldron, you encountered Helya, who cast you into Gorgoa, the River of Souls. You escaped the soul stream only to witness Baine being thrown off of Zovaal's Cauldron by the Jailer.\n\
Though you rescued Baine from the Mawsworn forces in Detrithus, he was afflicted by a spirit poison that prevented his wounds from healing. You and Thrall sought out the Wither Blade used to poison the High Chieftain and destroyed it, restoring Baine's health.\n\
With the aid of Jaina's invisibility spell, you and your allies snuck past Zovaal's Cauldron, witnessing mighty armies being rallied by the Jailer for an unknown purpose.\n\
You found the dormat waystone, which immediately responded to your presence. Sensing this, the Jailer sent the entirety of his forces to prevent your escape. While your allies fought to buy time, the waystone activated and freed you from the Maw.\n\
Though you were narrowly able to escape, your allies were taken by the Jailer. You arrived alone in the mysterious city of Oribos.",

You learn that your escape from the Maw caused a tremor across the Shadowlands which was felt in Oribos, and that the Overseers have never seen a living mortal in the Shadowlands.\n\
The Arbiter's Honored Voice, Tal-Inara, arrives and informs you that the Arbiter herself stirred briefly upon your activation of the waystone in the Maw. Tal-Inara escorts you to the Arbiter's chamber in the hope that your presence will awaken her\n\
In the chamber, Tal-Inara explains the Arbiter's role: to judge every soul entering the Shadowlands and determine the most appropriate afterlife for that soul based on its deeds in life.\n\
Recently, an unknown event caused the Arbiter to become dormant. Unable to fulfil her role of judging incoming souls, every soul entering the Shadowlands now goes directly to the Maw.\n\
This crisis has even deeper consequences. Without souls going to each of the afterlives of the Shadowlands, they lack anima, a resource that can only be gained from new souls. The Shadowlands is gripped by drought.\n\
Unfortunately, your presence is unable to wake the Arbiter. Returning to the main city, you are able to use the Helm of Domination to create a link to the mortal realm and bring Bolvar and the Ebon Blade to Oribos.\n\
Portals are established back to the major cities of mortal Azeroth, and you familiarise yourself with Oribos. Explaining to the Overseers the circumstances of your leaders' abduction by winged creatures, they suggest visiting the Kyrian of Bastion, who resemble the abductors despite their noble nature.\n\
The Overseers pledge to use some of their remaining anima to open a portal to Bastion. You step through the portal, and arrive in a brightly lit temple.",

The Forsworn launched a surprise attack upon the Temple of Purity, and you helped push it back. In your confrontation with Lysonia, former Hand of Loyalty and the leader of the assault, you were able to obtain a fragment of her essence with the Paragon of Purity's aid.",
